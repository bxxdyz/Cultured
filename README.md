<h1 align="center">Cultured</h1>

<p>
Cultured is a hip travel friendly api used to inform the user with general information about a countries region and culture. Our initial version allows the user to select their country and then use our useful API tools such as general info, currency converting, weather, restaurant locations, music or cultural facts.
</p>

<h4>Weather API and Basic Country Info API</h4>
<p>
The very first api in our Cultured app is country info and flag data. With this data people can see the size and read some facts about their country of interest. Next we included a temperature API which gives the temperature of the capital of a country!
</p>

<h4>Currency Converter API</h4>
<p>
In our application/website you will be able to use our converter to convert over 20+ currencies in reference to the USD. A very useful tool to evaluate how much your money is worth in a foreign country to read.
</p>

<h4>News API</h4>
<p>
Most travel applications do not include information about current events based on the country. We included a general news API that calls information about the select country. The API populates our news section and provides links for the user which opens up new tabs aside the app window, so the Cultured app remains uninterrupted. 
</p>

<h4>Resturants API</h4>
<p>
We added Yelp as our main API source provider for resturant information. One of the most common things to do outdoors is going out to eat so it was necessary to include this feature in our project. Some countries are not supported by Yelp but the majority of popular tourest countries are supported.
