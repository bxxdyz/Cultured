# Cultured
<h1>Project I</h1>
<p>
Cultured is a hip travel friendly api used to inform the user with general information about a countries region and culture. Our initial version allows the user to select their country and then use our useful API tools such as general info, currency converting, weather, restaurant locations, music or cultural facts.
</p>

<h4><b>The currency converter<b></h4>
<p>
In our application/website you will be able to use our converter to convert over 20+ currencies in reference to the USD. A very useful tool to evaluate how much your money is worth in a foreign country to read.
</p>

<h4><b>The Newsr<b></h4>
<p>
Most travel applications do not include information about current events based on the country. We included a general news API that calls information about the select country. The API populates our news section and provides links for the user which opens up new tabs aside the app window, so the Cultured app remains uninterrupted. 
</p>

<h4><b>Resturants<b></h4>
<p>
We included Yelp as our main API source provider for resturant information. One off the most highly common things to do outdoors is going out to eat so it was necessary to include this feature in our project. Some countries are not supported by Yelp.
